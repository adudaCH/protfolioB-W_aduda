            <h2>'The Deer Hunter'</h2>
            <span>The Deer Hunter (1978), directed by Michael Cimino, is a powerful war drama that follows the lives of three working-class friends—Michael, Nick, and Steven—from a small steel town in Pennsylvania. The story is told in three acts: life before, during, and after their service in the Vietnam War. It begins with their tight-knit community celebrating a wedding, then shifts dramatically to the horrors of war where the friends are captured and forced to play Russian roulette by their captors. After escaping, the trauma follows them home, especially for Nick, who becomes lost in the chaos of post-war Vietnam. The film explores friendship, identity, the scars of war, and the slow erosion of innocence.</span>
