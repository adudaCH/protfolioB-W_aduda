            <h2>'The Imitation Game'</h2>
            <span>TThe Imitation Game (2014) is a historical drama based on the life of Alan Turing, a brilliant but socially awkward mathematician who led a team of codebreakers at Britain's Bletchley Park during World War II. Their mission: crack Nazi Germany's seemingly unbreakable Enigma code. Despite resistance from his peers and the burden of secrecy, Turing designs a revolutionary machine that eventually deciphers the code-shortening the war and saving millions of lives. The film also explores his personal struggles, particularly the persecution he faced later in life for his homosexuality, which was illegal in the UK at the time.
